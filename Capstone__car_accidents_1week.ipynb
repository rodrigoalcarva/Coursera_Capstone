    "There is a huge impact on the society due to traffic accidents where there is a great costs of fatalities and injuries. In recent years, there is a increase in the researches attention to determine the significantly affect the severity of the drivers injuris which is caused due to the road accidents.\n",
    "Accidents have become very common these days. Nearly 1.25 million people a day die in road chases each year, on average, 3,287 deaths a day. Moreover, 20-50 million people are injured or disabled annualy. \n",
    "Car accidents are one of the common types of collision occurring everywhere globally every day. By analysing the different factors which cause the collision. In this section we are discussing about data Capstone project topic Car accident servity."

    "Officials could use such information to direct safety efforts at the stretches of road where the impacts coud be the biggest. In the context of this research, some of the developed countries like US, UK governments could use the information generated from a prediction system with a Neural Network predicting the accident severity and use this information to enhance the laws to build safer roads for the future. In this project we are dealing with the all the possible ways to reach the destination by overcoming car accident servery with the different critical traffic conditions on the way to journey."

    "- Analyse data for the factors, which can impact accident rates.\n",
    "- Determine type of road classes with highest and lowest amount of accident rates from analysing tables of road accidents statistics and charts created from the database UK-2019 accident set"
